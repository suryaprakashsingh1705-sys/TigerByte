# 🐯 TigerByte

TigerByte is a multilingual, tiger-themed toy programming language currently in conceptual development.

## Status
🚧 **In Development** — project shell created, core design in progress.

## Vision
TigerByte explores how programming language design, multilingual command parsing, and creative syntax can enhance both coding and language learning.

## Planned Features
- Commands in **English**, **Mandarin**, and **German**
- Aliases for thematic verbs like `feed`, `chase`, and `say`
- Simple interpreter written in **Python**
- Educational focus on bridging natural and programming languages

## Structure
- `src/` → Core interpreter logic  
- `docs/` → Design notes and supporting documents  
- `tests/` → Future testing suite  

## Project History
- **Concept Initiation:** *October 7, 2025*  
  The initial concept for TigerByte was conceived as a creative exploration into programming language design, combining multilingual commands and thematic syntax to make learning both fun and educational.

- **Repository Setup:** *October 18, 2025*  
  Project structure and documentation shell established, marking the official start of development.

## Next Steps
1. Define core command set (`feed`, `chase`, `say`, etc.) and their behavior.  
2. Design command alias mappings for English, Mandarin, and German.  
3. Build a minimal interpreter in Python to execute simple TigerByte scripts.  
4. Implement a feedback loop for command parsing and multilingual input.  
5. Expand documentation with syntax examples and language reference.
